Description: Practice working with event listeners, since this is a common web feature. Pick one of the following ideas or come up 
with your own project idea. Submit source code along with some sort of easily found description (i.e. readme file) that describes your
project.

Suggestion: Build a pong game clone and/or credit card number verification. Both of these ideas have event listeners that react to 
real-time user input. Implementation details are up to you.
