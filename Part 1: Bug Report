App: Mcdonalds
Environment: 
Device and OS: Samsung Galaxy S8+ Android 9
Testable App Version: 6.4
Network: Wi-Fi/LTE 
Location: Brooklyn, NY, USA
Reproducability: 4/4
Steps to reproduce + Expected Result + Actual Result: 
Whenever I launch the app, I usually realize that I am signed out and sign back in or it usually occur when redeeming a coupon, I'd 
be signed out of the account for no apparent reason and when I do attempt to sign in, I'd be stuck on the fries jumping animation 
indicating that it is attempting to complete the task or load but it either throws me into a loop or the animation disappears and unable 
to sign in until I've cleared the data through settings. Worst case scenario, usually this method wouldn't work and would force me to 
reinstall the app.
Possible fix: The connection between google account(s) and the Mcdonald's app must have not been executed well and needs to fixed on the 
backend of the application.
