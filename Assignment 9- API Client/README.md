* To run this api successfully, it would require a working Rapid API key from https://rapidapi.com/ that can be found once an account is
created and to visit https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/the-cocktail-db?endpoint=apiendpoint_49b98879-938e-4479-b0da-718468fb87bc for
snippets of code corresponding to the langauge and an API key.

* For convenience, I've provided an API key I've used under both codes, so you simply copy the code and replace the "Your API key". The main_api.py is for user inputs where they can select the number of their choice for beverage and the HTML_api.py redirects that input to a .html file that will be generated under the same project in the IDE and the user simply right clicks the list.html and find "Open in Browser" in the context menu and select the browser of choice to view what beverages are offered in that category.
