Objective: The goal is to connect to an API end point of your choice, such as NASA Picture of the Day and display the information from the API in nicely formatted way. You may use any language or framework of choice, consult documentation for that particular tool.

Description: The implementation details can be up to you, for completing specific tasks outlined:

Access data from an API end point. Feel free to use something like https://postwoman.io/ to preview the response from a HTTP GET request.
Parse the data, which requires understanding their data structures
Parse out specific values to display as html web page
Write documentation such as a README that includes instructions on how to run the app running locally on your machine
Submit the source code

Advice on select APIs: In previous semesters students have personalized this project with other datasets such as connecting to, Spotify, Anime, MLB, etc. Some APIs are public and thus less configuration needed to connect with.

Advice on selecting language(s), web framework(s): Some languages such as Python and JavaScript have more libraries available to make it very easy to get started. You can also experiment with bleeding edge languages such as Rust, Go, etc.
