Tesla's Architecture: 
Tesla has revealed its revolutionary new wiring architecture that enables more robot automation in the manufacturing process and uses 
fewer materials for its upcoming cars like Model Y and Tesla Pickup truck. CEO Elon Musk said that one of their biggest mistakes with

robots, like manipulating cables.
